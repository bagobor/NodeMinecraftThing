*UNIX ONLY*  Sorry windows guys :(

Some general notes:
  
  *** All scripts should be run from the root source directory ***

Example first time start up:

  % ./scripts/setup.sh
  % ./scripts/start.sh

How to stop the server:

  % ./scripts/stop.sh

How to do unit tests:

  % ./scripts/run_tests.sh

Notes on the directory structure:

  common - Javascript files that are shared by the server and the client
  www - The wwwroot directory for the client
  www/img - Images for the client
  www/shaders - Client shaders
  scripts - Administration scripts for the server
  mongo - Directory for local install of mongodb
  data - The database directory
  data/db - MongoDB database goes here
  data/keyfile - Randomly generated database administrator password
  data/config.txt - Database configuration

Administration Scripts:

  setup.sh - Downloads and installs mongodb locally; sets up configuration and schema automatically.
  build_proto.sh - Recompiles all the protocol buffer files
  start_db.sh - Starts a local instance of the mongodb server (currently unsharded, but good enough).
  start_server.sh - Starts a local instance of the game server
  start.sh - Starts both the game server and the database
  stop.sh - Kills the server and database
  run_tests.sh - Runs unit tests

Testing Scripts:
  
  chrome.sh - Starts server and tests the game in chrome
  firefox.sh - Tests the game in firefox
  
TODO:

  Add opera test script
  Add unit tests
  Get a hosting service :)
