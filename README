*UNIX ONLY*  Sorry windows guys :(

Some general notes:
  
  * All scripts should be run from the root directory
  * Must have node.js and npm installed first (FIXME: Maybe make this install automatically?)
  * Start database server *before* starting the game server.


Example first time start up:

  % ./scripts/setup.sh
  % ./scripts/start_db.sh
  % ./scripts/start_server.sh


After set up, example start up:

  % ./scripts/start_db.sh
  % ./scripts/start_server.sh

Administration Scripts:

  setup.sh - Downloads and installs mongodb locally; sets up configuration and schema automatically.
  start_db.sh - Starts a local instance of the mongodb server (currently unsharded, but good enough).
  start_server.sh - Starts the actual server.  

Testing Scripts:
  
  chrome.sh - Tests the game in chrome
  firefox.sh - Tests the game in firefox
  
TODO:

  Add opera test script
  Add unit tests
  Get a real hosting platform :)
